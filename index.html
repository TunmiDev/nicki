              Nicki Minaj is often referred to as the "Queen of Rap" due to her
              significant impact on the music industry, particularly in the hip-hop
              genre. Her unique style, versatility, and ability to blend different
              musical elements have set her apart from her peers. She has a
              distinctive voice and a wide vocal range, allowing her to switch
              between singing and rapping seamlessly.

              Minaj's lyrics often explore themes of empowerment, sexuality, and
              personal struggles, resonating with a diverse audience. She has
              consistently pushed boundaries in her music and visuals, challenging
              societal norms and expectations. Her influence extends beyond music,
